            Despite Hyundai's obvious <strong>predisposition towards chaos</strong>, the room
            is not very messy because Hyundai does not own many things,
            and, in fact, all of his belongings are contained within his <strong>Inventory</strong>.

        <p> The universe is trying its hardest not to be opaque, but it's been real busy with work lately,
            so <strong>JS1</strong> will have to demand some answers to move the story forward. </p>

        <p> Unfortunately, <strong>JS1</strong> does not have an <strong>instantiated character</strong>, so
            there is nobody in this universe for her to control. They might consider trying the command
            <code> >>> create character </code> to begin. They could also try interacting with the universe
            as an <strong>Uninstantiated Character</strong>, but their interaction options are extremely limited.</p>

        <p>Lilith has been holed up in her room for hours, quiet.
            Anyone peeping in through a surveillance system would've noticed
            her sitting resolutely in the middle of the tiny bit of floor that
            was hers, eyes closed, still but for breathing.
            For all intents and purposes, she is apparently sleeping.
        </p>

        <p>In fact, she is pondering the secrets of the universe.
        Expanding her awareness.
        Focusing on peace and love towards all things.
        Surrounding all space with an aura of blue harmony.
        Stilling her mind until she can almost feel the pulse
        of the wisdom of the ages pounding in her head...
        </p>

        <p>...and maybe sleeping a little bit, too.
        Meditation is hard work!
        </p>

        <p>When all is said and done, however, she concentrates on a single,
        burning question:
        </p>

        <p>What do the stars portend to be the optimal course of action
        regarding today's lunch?
