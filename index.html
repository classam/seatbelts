            so <strong>JS1</strong> will have to demand some answers to move the story forward. </p>

        <p> Unfortunately, <strong>JS1</strong> does not have an <strong>instantiated character</strong>, so
            there is nobody in this universe for her to control. They might consider trying the command
            <code> >>> create character </code> to begin. They could also try interacting with the universe

            was hers, eyes closed, still but for breathing.
            For all intents and purposes, she is apparently sleeping.
        </p>

        <p>In fact, she is pondering the secrets of the universe.
        Expanding her awareness.
        Focusing on peace and love towards all things.
        Surrounding all space with an aura of blue harmony.
        Stilling her mind until she can almost feel the pulse
        of the wisdom of the ages pounding in her head...
        </p>

        <p>...and maybe sleeping a little bit, too.
        Meditation is hard work!
        </p>

        <p>When all is said and done, however, she concentrates on a single,
        burning question:

        <p>What do the stars portend to be the optimal course of action
        regarding today's lunch?

        <p> <strong> Waitron </strong> keeps trying to fry socks. Anso intends to take a closer look at that, eventually.</p>

        Athena realizes after the run-in with the stowaway
        how very ill-prepared she is to go venturing very far.
        She heads back to her room to look around for anything
        that might be useful to take with her on a journey outside the ship.
        Probably, you know, like... a weapon that's better than a bottle,
        just in case there are any more asleep people.

        <p> Normally, Athena's outstanding <strong>Notice</strong> would help in
            a situation like this, but she knows everything that's going on
            in her room anyways. </p>
        <p> Her wall is covered with a <strong>Jackson Pollock poster </strong>
            a few <strong>Klimt posters</strong> and a <strong>static city poster</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>Somehow she strongly identifies with <strong>posters that create meaningful
                patterns out of seemingly random data.</strong><p>
            <p>Athena's <strong>beat-up bear</strong> sits forlornly in the corner.
                It's lightly abused, but it knows that it will be coming along with her
                on any given journey. That's the only way to <strong>keep it safe.</strong>
                </p>
            <p>There's a <strong>stain</strong> under her bed, but it's not as
                sinister as it looks. It has to do with a misplaced <strong>Jelly Sandwich</strong>.</p>
            <p>On her end table is her <strong>medication</strong>, which
            is supposed to help Athena keep her <strong>violent episodes</strong>
            under control, but do not seem to help too much. </p>
            <p> There's her identi-wallet - but not a usual one. Athena's identi-wallet
            is a ratty <strong>Anonymous Identiwallet</strong> - the only one
            she could get without any sort of identity paperwork. It marks her as
            a <strong>nonentity</strong> with none of the rights afforded to a
            <strong>colonist</strong> or a <strong>citizen</strong>. </p>
            <p> Her <strong>knuckles</strong> and her <strong>gun</strong> sit on the
                table. They are last resort tools but they always seem to get the job
                done. </p>
            <p> There is a <strong>W</strong> sitting under the end-table. Probably
                enough money to buy something small in town. </p>
            <p> There are also some <strong> books </strong> in the end table. </p>

        <p> Anso's two active <strong>Questacles</strong> are <strong>Eat Breakfast</strong>
            and <strong>Run the Jyrgal Burger</strong> </p>

        <p> <strong>Eat Breakfast</strong> should be easy - Anso should grab anything out of his
            room that he's likely to need for the day, head downstairs to the
            <strong>Jyrgal Burger's kitchen</strong>,
            and fry himself up an egg and some toast. Or make some porridge.
            It's really up to him. Anso's kitchen is well stocked. </p>

        <p> <strong>Running the Jyrgal Burger</strong> is a little more involved.
            Anso likes to use his <strong>PIP</strong> to check if there are any
            new ships docked at the <strong>Space Port</strong> nearby. Usually
            if there is, that means a hungry crew is going to come barrelling in,
            and Anso likes to be prepared - prepping vegetables, putting oil in the
            fryer, the whole nine yards. If not, business is usually pretty laconic -
            Anso would offer the "light menu" and probably spend most of the day
            fiddling with Waitron's programming. </p>

        Lilith yawns and opens her eyes, and blithely hops off her bed.
        Enough of that! She does somehow feel as if she's learned a lot
        about the universe, but if someone attempted to quiz her on
        those learnings, she'd probably just mysteriously smile
        and give a bullshitty non-answer. That's how she rolls.
        </p>

        She looks around the room as she ponders her meditations.

        A cheeseburger does, in fact, sound like a fantastic idea.

        <p> <a href='https://vimeo.com/13497928'>Have you worked out what we're looking for? </a></p>
        <p> Correct. The answer is: Weapons and cash! </p>
        <p> Lilith's room contains a couple of <strong> cat posters </strong>,
            a poster of some kind of <strong>fondant masterpiece</strong>,
            a <strong> pillow</strong>, a trusty <strong>pipe wrench</strong> that
            can be used for both <em>basic fixin'</em> and <em>basic people-whackin'</em>,
            a perfectly normal <strong>"magic" eight-ball</strong> for when
            Lilith doesn't feel like stressing her mind's eye, her <strong>laundry</strong>,
            and some <strong>neatly folded linens and clothes</strong>.</p>
        <p>
            On her end-table is a <strong>cheater's identi-wallet</strong> -
            a special identiwallet
            favored by con-persons that can be used to store multiple identities
            as the situation calls for. </p>
        <p> She also has a <strong>FacePIP</strong>, which is very like a normal PIP,
            except it contains the contact information of just about every useful
            or interesting person in the entire solar system, only half of whom
            are currently looking to violently extract some form of retribution
            from Lilith.</p>
        <p> There's <strong>1 KiloWealth</strong>, which should be enough to get
            burgers for everyone on board, with ample change. Lilith is fond of
            keeping her money in hard crypto-chipped paper currency, rather than
            tied to her <strong>identi-wallet</strong>, on account of
            her identities being a little more <em>flexible</em> than average.</p>

                                        runs the full menu when ships are in town. </li>

        <p> We're on the outskirts of <strong>Myerth</strong>, a town on the volcanically active moon, <strong>Io</strong>.</p>
        <p> The atmosphere is <strong>breathable</strong> but rich in the potent funk of <strong>sulphur.</strong></p>
        <p> The distant <strong>Geothermal Judy</strong> provides millions of lumens of light and heat at full power, but it's early morning,
            so it's still dim.</p>
        <p> The <strong>Jyrgal Burger</strong> is the closest burger shack to the SpacePort. </p>
        <p> It sits next to a <strong>Gulp</strong>, an always-open convenience store that
            sells a variety of dried snacks, candy bars, magazines, and similarly convenient items.</p>
        <p> The third building on this strip is the <strong>gas n' such</strong>, which focuses on
            <strong>various methods of charging, fueling, and light maintenance</strong> for the ships that come through. </p>
        <p> Together, these three businesses are the only ones within walking distance of the
            SpacePort. </p>
        <p> To travel further out, someone would need to <strong>call for a taxi ride on their PIP</strong>, or <strong>find a vehicle.</strong></p>

            <li><strong>ASS Dan:</strong> So, that's the one? </li>
            <li><strong>Dall:</strong> Yeah, that's the <strong>Croque Madame</strong>. It's a big ship. </li>
            <li><strong>ASS Dan:</strong> Think we're going to get anybody? </li>
            <li><strong>Dall:</strong> The best way to find bounties is to watch what shady ships like this are up to. </li>
            <li><strong>ASS Dan:</strong> I haven't seen anybody go in or out.
                I bet it's empty and we waste our whole day. </li>
            <li><strong>Dall:</strong> Calm down, Eeyore. Wanna place a wager on it?  </li>
            <li><strong>ASS Dan:</strong> What kind of wager? </li>
            <li><strong>Dall:</strong> I'll bet you 20 Dubs that there's a bounty on board that ship.  </li>
            <li><strong>ASS Dan:</strong> Hah. Sure, give me your money, if that cheers you up.  </li>
            <li>...</li>
            <li><strong>Dall:</strong> It's chilly out. I hope the Burger joint opens up soon. </li>
            <li><strong>ASS Dan:</strong> Yeah, I could really go for a coffee and some dippy eggs and soldiers.</li>
            <li><strong>Dall:</strong> Why do you always order that? You could make that at home really easily. </li>
            <li><strong>ASS Dan:</strong> <em>shrugs</em>. Just like 'em, I guess. </li>
            <li><strong>Dall:</strong> Wish the place would open up already. </li>
            <li><strong>ASS Dan:</strong> Be patient. It's early. The <strong>Judy</strong>'s barely even up. </li>
